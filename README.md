# InstrumentsTelecopes
This repo gathers information about the existing lists of Instruments 
used in Astrophysics and Planetary science. 

It also contains lists of Telescopes on earth or on board of satellites or other facilities.

There are N..---..N relations between telescopes and instruments, most of the time simple ones like 
Telescope 1..---..N Instrument. 

The diagram in "telescopeinstrumentsdico190510.png" shows the relationships considered in a first modeling attempt in 2019.
